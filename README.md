# Subgrounds
A Pythonic data access layer for applications querying data from The Graph Network.

## Design goals
- **Simple**: Small, easy to use toplevel API
- **Automated**: Schema introspection and class generation, type checking and pagination is all handled automatically
- **Schema-driven**: Queries are built with `FieldPaths` while transformations are defined with `SyntheticFields`, as opposed to raw GraphQL and transforming raw data

## Installation
**IMPORTANT**: Subgrounds requires Python version 3.10 or higher

Subgrounds is available on PyPi. To install it, run the following:<br>
`pip install subgrounds`.

Subgrounds also comes bundled with some handy `dash` wrappers. To use those wrappers, you can install the extra `dash` dependencies.<br>
`pip install subgrounds[dash]`.

## Simple example
```python
>>> from subgrounds.subgrounds import Subgrounds

>>> sg = Subgrounds()
>>> aaveV2 = sg.load_subgraph('https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/aave/protocol-v2')

>>> aaveV2.Borrow.adjusted_amount = aaveV2.Borrow.amount / 10 ** aaveV2.Borrow.reserve.decimals

>>> last10_borrows = aaveV2.Query.borrows(
...   orderBy=aaveV2.Borrow.timestamp,
...   orderDirection='desc',
...   first=10
... )

>>> sg.query_df([
...   last10_borrows.reserve.symbol, 
...   last10_borrows.timestamp,
...   last10_borrows.adjusted_amount
... ])
  borrows_reserve_symbol  borrows_timestamp  borrows_adjusted_amount

## About us
Protean Labs was started by web3 data enthusiasts to build open source tooling for The Graph Network as part of its grants program. Although Protean Labs remains an independent entity, the team has since joined [Playgrounds](https://www.playgrounds.network/) with the goal of revolutionizing the web3 data stack.

<!-- # Dash and Plotly wrappers
Subgrounds provides wrappers for Plotly objects and Dash components to facilitate visualization of data from The Graph.

Plotly wrappers can be found in the `subgrounds.plotly_wrappers` submodule. The wrappers include a `Figure` wrapper as well as wrappers for most Plotly traces (see https://plotly.com/python/reference/). All Plotly trace wrappers accept the same arguments as their underlying Plotly trace with the notable difference being that Subgrounds `FieldPath` objects can be used as arguments wherever one would usually provide data to the traces.

```python
from subgrounds.plotly_wrappers import Bar, Figure
from subgrounds.dash_wrappers import Graph

borrows = aaveV2.Query.borrows(
  orderBy=aaveV2.Borrow.timestamp,
  orderDirection='desc',
  first=100
)

repays = aaveV2.Query.repays(
  orderBy=aaveV2.Repay.timestamp,
  orderDirection='desc',
  first=100
)

# Dashboard
app = dash.Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div(
  html.Div([
    html.H4('Entities'),
    html.Div([
      # Subgrounds Graph Dash component
      Graph(
        # A Subgrounds Plotly figure 
        Figure(
          subgrounds=sg,
          traces=[
            # Subgrounds Plotly traces
            Bar(x=borrows.reserve.symbol, y=borrows.amount),
            Bar(x=repays.reserve.symbol, y=repays.amount)
          ]
        )
      )
    ])
  ])
)
``` -->

<!-- # Notes
## Non-subgraph GraphQL APIs
Although Subgrounds has been developed with subgraph APIs in mind, most features will also work with any GraphQL API. However, Subgrounds has not been tested with non-subgraph GraphQL APIs and some features will definitely break if the non-subgraph APIs do not follow the same conventions as subgraph APIs (e.g.: automatic pagination relies on each entity having a unique `id` field).

It is nonetheless possible to use Subgrounds with non-subgraph GraphQL APIs by using `load_api` instead of `load_subgraph`. This will bypass Subgrounds automatic pagination feature and pagination will therefore have to be done manually. Below is an example of using Subgrounds with the snapshot GraphQL API.
```python
>>> from datetime import datetime

>>> from subgrounds.subgrounds import Subgrounds
>>> from subgrounds.subgraph import SyntheticField

>>> sg = Subgrounds()
>>> snapshot = sg.load_api('https://hub.snapshot.org/graphql')

>>> snapshot.Proposal.datetime = SyntheticField(
...   lambda timestamp: str(datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp)),
...   SyntheticField.STRING,
...   snapshot.Proposal.end,
... )

>>> proposals = snapshot.Query.proposals(
...   orderBy='created',
...   orderDirection='desc',
...   first=100,
...   where=[
...     snapshot.Proposal.space == 'olympusdao.eth',
...     snapshot.Proposal.state == 'closed'
...   ]
... )

>>> sg.query_df([
...   proposals.datetime,
...   proposals.title,
...   proposals.votes,
... ])

## GraphQL Aliases
The use of the alias `xf608864358427cfb` in the query string is to prevent conflict when merging fieldpaths that select the same fields with different arguments. For example, in the following code, the `borrows` query field is selected twice with different arguments:
```python
>>> latest_borrows = aaveV2.Query.borrows(
...  orderBy=aaveV2.Borrow.timestamp,
...  orderDirection='desc',
...  first=100
...)

>>> largest_borrows = aaveV2.Query.borrows(
...  orderBy=aaveV2.Borrow.amount,
...  orderDirection='desc',
...  first=100
...)

>>> req = sg.mk_request([
...   latest_borrows.reserve.symbol,
...   latest_borrows.amount,
...   largest_borrows.reserve.symbol,
...   largest_borrows.amount,
... ])
>>> print(req.graphql)
query {
  x8b3edf3dc6501837: borrows(first: 100, orderBy: amount, orderDirection: desc) {
    reserve {
      symbol
    }
    amount
  }
  xf608864358427cfb: borrows(first: 100, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {
    reserve {
      symbol
    }
    amount
  }
}
``` -->
